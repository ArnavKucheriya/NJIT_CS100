The purpose of functions
- Modularity: They allow us to break down complex problems that require complex programs into small, simple, self-contained pieces. Each small piece can be implemented, tested, and debugged independently.
- Abstraction: A function has a name that should clearly reflects what it does. That action can then be performed by calling the function by name, abstracting what the function does from how it does it.
- Reusability: Code that may be used multiple times should be packaged in a function. The code only needs to be written once. And any time that it needs to be modified, extended or debugged, the changes need to be made only once.
